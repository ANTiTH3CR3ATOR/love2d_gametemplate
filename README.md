love2d_gametemplate
===================

This is a gametemplate for LÃ–VE engine using middleclass, stateful, love-loader, TESound and cron libraries.

Features
- The aim of this template is to seperate ressource loading from scenes.
- A ressource reference is submitted to a Loading State and the ressources are loaded via love-loader library.
- Loading of ressources is visualised via love-loader library.
- After all Ressources are loaded, the Loading State switches to a Next-State.
- All ressources are accessed via the global variable 'media'.
- All ressources share the same naming ... so you can overwrite existing ones using the same name.
- You can add additional ressources during any state switch.
- TESound library is enhanced to also play sounddata.
- Images can be used raw or as Texture-Atlas without changing the drawing code

Sample
  media.quads['left-hand-climber-hi']:draw(0,0) -- single file image (no Quad)
  media.quads['left-hand-climber-hi3']:draw(love.mouse.getX(), love.mouse.getY()) --from texture atlas (image with Quads)
